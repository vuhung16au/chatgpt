# Ten Prompt Strategies 

Sure, here are ten commonly used prompting strategies when interacting with a generative AI like ChatGPT, along with examples for each:

## Direct Question Prompts: 

These prompts are straightforward questions that ask the AI for specific information or a specific task.

Example Prompts:

- What is the capital of Australia?
- Translate this English text to French: “Hello, how are you?”
- Write a short poem about spring.

## Instructional Prompts: 
These prompts give the AI a specific task to perform, often involving some form of creative generation.

Example Prompts:

- Write a short story about a robot learning to paint.
- Generate a recipe for a chocolate cake.
- Create a trivia question about space exploration.

## Exploratory Prompts: 

These prompts encourage the AI to generate more open-ended and creative content, often by posing hypothetical scenarios or asking for opinions.

Example Prompts:

- Imagine a world where animals can talk. What would a day in such a world be like?
- What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of self-driving cars?
- How might the world change if humans could live for 200 years?

## Elaboration Prompts: 
These prompts ask the AI to expand on a given topic or idea, providing more detail or depth.

Example Prompts:

- Elaborate on the impact of climate change on global agriculture.
- Can you provide more details about the French Revolution?
- Explain the process of photosynthesis in more detail.

## Clarification Prompts: 

These prompts ask the AI to clarify a statement or concept, often by rephrasing or providing an example.

Example Prompts:

- Can you clarify what is meant by “machine learning”?
- What does the term “quantum computing” mean?
- Can you explain what “blockchain technology” is?

## Comparison Prompts: 

These prompts ask the AI to compare two or more things.

Example Prompts:

- Compare the climates of Australia and Canada.
- What are the similarities and differences between cats and dogs?
- Compare and contrast classical and modern art.
- Scenario-based Prompts: These prompts present a hypothetical scenario and ask the AI to respond or provide insight.

Example Prompts:

- If you were stranded on a deserted island, what three items would you want to have?
- Imagine you’re a detective in a mystery novel. How would you solve the case?
- If you could travel back in time, what period would you visit and why?

## Creative Generation Prompts: 

These prompts ask the AI to generate creative content, such as stories, poems, or jokes.

Example Prompts:

- Write a short science fiction story set on Mars.
- Compose a haiku about the ocean.
- Tell a funny joke about a penguin.

## Opinion-based Prompts: 
These prompts ask the AI to provide an opinion or perspective on a topic. Remember, AI doesn’t have personal experiences or emotions, but it can generate responses based on data it has been trained on.

Example Prompts:

- What are some arguments for and against artificial intelligence?
- What are the pros and cons of renewable energy?
- Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of remote work.

## Prediction Prompts: 

These prompts ask the AI to make a prediction based on certain conditions or information.

Example Prompts:

- What could be the potential impact of AI on the job market?
- How might climate change affect global economies in the future?
- Predict the next big trend in technology.

Remember, the key to effective prompting with AI is to be clear and specific about what you’re asking for. The AI doesn’t understand context in the same way humans do, so providing as much relevant information in your prompt will help get the best results. Also, feel free to iterate and experiment with different prompts to see what works best!
