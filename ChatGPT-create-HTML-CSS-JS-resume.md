# ChatGPT's Answer

Sure, I can help you create a basic structure for a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <title>Vu Hung Nguyen</title>
    <style>
        body {

            color: white;
        }
        .container {
            max-width: 800px;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }
        .section {
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }

```

This is a very basic structure. You can expand on this by adding more sections, styling them with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript. Remember to replace the placeholder text with your actual content.

Please note that you should not put sensitive information (like your full address or phone number) on a public website for privacy reasons. Instead, consider using a contact form or providing an email address for people to reach you. Also, remember to validate and sanitize any user input if youâ€™re planning to use a contact form to prevent security vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™re new to web development, there are many resources available online to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
