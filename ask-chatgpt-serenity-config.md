How to set timezone to Sydney in serenity (using serenity.conf or serenity.properties) 

# ChatGPT Answer


To set the timezone to Sydney in Serenity BDD using the serenity.conf or serenity.properties file, you can use the corresponding timezone identifier for Sydney, which is "Australia/Sydney." Here's how you can do it:

## Using serenity.conf (YAML format):

```yaml
# serenity.conf

timezone: "Australia/Sydney"
```

## Using serenity.properties (Properties format):

```
# serenity.properties

timezone=Australia/Sydney
```

These configurations will set the default timezone for your Serenity BDD project to Sydney's timezone. The specified timezone will be used when Serenity generates reports, logs, and timestamps.

Remember to restart your test execution or build process after making changes to the configuration file for the changes to take effect.
